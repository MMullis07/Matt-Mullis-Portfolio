# Portfolio-Site
- Currently a static site that is built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I have added hover effects using media queries.
- I have also used JavaScript to include fade in transtions and slide-in transitions.
- I still need to update my projects/portfolio sections and host it on heroku to make it fully dynamic.
